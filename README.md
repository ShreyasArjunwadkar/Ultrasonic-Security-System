# Ultrasonic Security System 🔒📡
The Ultrasonic Security System is a modern security solution designed to provide reliable and efficient access control and intrusion detection. By combining ultrasonic proximity sensors, RFID access control, and mobile alerts, this system showcases advanced IoT integration and sensor fusion to deliver enhanced security.

Features 🌟
Proximity Detection 📏: Ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor the area for any unauthorized movement.
RFID Access Control 🛂: Securely manage entry and exit using RFID, ensuring only authorized personnel can access restricted areas.
Real-Time Mobile Alerts 📲: Sends instant alerts to a connected mobile device if any unusual activity is detected.
IoT Integration 🌐: The system is designed to communicate data over the internet, enabling remote monitoring and control.
System Components 🔧
Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect proximity and monitor the surroundings to identify any unauthorized movement.
RFID Module: Manages access control by validating RFID tags for secure entry.
ESP32 Microcontroller: Serves as the central hub, processing data from sensors and managing communication.
Mobile Notification System: Sends real-time alerts to the user’s mobile device whenever security events are triggered.
How It Works ⚙️
Detection: Ultrasonic sensors constantly monitor the designated area for any presence within its range.
Access Control: Users scan their RFID tag at entry points. Only verified tags allow access, keeping unauthorized personnel out.
Alert System: If unauthorized movement is detected or if an unrecognized RFID tag is scanned, an alert is sent to the registered mobile device, notifying the user immediately.

The Ultrasonic Security System is an efficient and modern approach to secure spaces with IoT-based smart features. Contributions are welcome, and any suggestions for improvement are greatly appreciated!
